      <h2>Jordan Walker</h2>
      <h4>Founder & Managing Partner</h4>
      <p>
        Jordan is the Founder and Managing Partner of JCI Prop, bringing nearly 20 years of commercial real estate experience across Texas. He has worked with industry-leading firms including NAI Partners, HPI Real Estate Services & Investments, and CBRE, and is known for cultivating long-standing, loyal relationships with high-end clients built on trust, consistency, and results.
Prior to entering commercial real estate, Jordan served as a Legislative Aide in the Texas House of Representatives for Rep. Charlie Geren of Fort Worth. That experience shaped his relationship-driven approach to business and gave him firsthand exposure to the intersection of policy, enterprise, and leadership alongside some of the state’s most respected decision-makers.
Jordan began his brokerage career at NAI Partners in Houston, representing both owners and users in Office and Retail transactions. He later joined HPI, where he specialized in Industrial and Creative Office Leasing, primarily representing ownership. During his tenure, he was part of a team that leased more than 11 million square feet of space, earned Heavy Hitter recognition starting his first year, and ultimately led HPI’s San Antonio office while continuing leasing efforts throughout Austin and the I-35 corridor.
At JCI Prop, Jordan applies this experience with a clear focus: delivering strategic real estate solutions while building enduring relationships—one square foot at a time.
